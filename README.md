Rules and Gameplay
=================
This is a simple rougelike/RPG/visual novel made in Ren'Py.
You use your mouse to do basically everything.
There are no graphics, but this is completely intentional.
First, you attack the enemy. Then, they attack you.
Don't die. 
You can save whenever you want.
Most roguelikes are a lot harder than this.
